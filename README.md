Introduction and Description of the objects of in the scene

Introduction:
The objective of this computer graphics project is to design a scene to visualize the space view using javafx 2D and 3D.

Description:
The scene represents a view of the sun and earth from the surfaceofthe moon, as the space is in the background. Also,The Saudi flag is installed in the moon surface .
Sun:the sphere is used to representsthe sun's shape, also a colored lighting(point light) is been used to represents the flames of the sun .also, a keyboard/mouse event is added to the sun object to add a motion.
Press "W" and the sun will appear like its going away, press "S" and the sun will come back, press "Y" and it will be translated in the Z-axisalso, press "D" and the sun will drop on the moon surface.
Earth: 
the sphere is used to representsthe earth's shape,also a colored lighting(point and AmbientLight)is been used to represents the sun's light reflecting on earth. We used mapping tomap the earth's picture on the sphere.and, a keyboard/mouse event is added to the earth object to add a motionas follows:light will appear-a Blue point"P"when Press -light will appear-a Yellow point"I"when Press -light will appear-pointGreena "U"when Press -light will appear-a Brown point"F"when Press  --when Press the  "Right" Button the earth will spin -When a primary mouse button is pressed the earth will spin vertically 

For the flag, we used cylinder as the stick for the flag. Also, a box for the flag itself and Saudi flag was mapped is added to the flag. a primitive shapeAnd .to it.
Moon surface: a box object was used to represents the moon surface then a moon surface picture was mapped to the box to make it realistic.

Background:
a Imageobject was used to represents the space and the stars, a picture of the space view is mapped to the ImageViewin the background."O"Scene, Press Light is added to the -Also, an ambientand it will turn On..to its natural lookand the scene will return“R”Press
